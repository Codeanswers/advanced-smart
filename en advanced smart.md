*Suppose there is a desire to make a staircase, but not a simple one, but a handmade one in the form of a spiral*:
######I: Introductory
> Circumstances and events associated with the stairs
###### O: Need, inconvenience
>Where do you need a ladder?
###### S: What should I do?
>No unlimited stairs
> > `-Tell me, which path can I take to get out of here? - And where are you going? – the Cat answered with a question. “I don’t know,” answered Alice. - Well, then you will come there along any path. `
###### M: How do you know when a goal is complete?
> The length of the required staircase or factors that will indicate whether the length is sufficient
###### A: Goal achievability. How difficult is the goal? What will help? What's going to get in the way? What can help or hinder?
> The staircase is realistic or rather fantastic, like an elevator to space
> > Is the target within the optimal Goldilocks zone?
###### R: Current: Benefit. Main and secondary
> Number of nishtyaks at the end of the stairs. Comparison of the good stuff on this staircase and that one over there. 20% gives 80%
> > If you divide all tasks into percentage priority, where 1% are the most important tasks, and 100% are the most minor ones, what percentage will this goal be at?
###### T: Required/Available/End Time
> Stairs are stairs and lunch is on schedule
###### E: Sustainability and alignment with collective goals
> The benefits of ladders for /b/rata aspirations
###### R: Recorded: Conscious through memory records
> Multi-colored pens and structuring gags
###### P: Plan or structures
> 1) prescribe goal setting - creating motivation - a well-trodden road is like a set ladder, all that remains is to climb; <br>
> 2) act chaos-intuitively - from a bungee into the river - forge while it’s hot; <br>
> 3) act quickly - do not use slow memory; <br>
> 4) read motivating literature - if there is no motivation and goal-setting methodologies have dried up; <br>
> 5) express the structure for clarity, ease of use / no need to do unnecessary things and the opportunity to focus on the most important thing; <br>
###### In Brief
> The very essence
###### Result
> Praise yourself or scold yourself. <br>
> Frame the praise on the wall, hide the scolding - it’s already well remembered <br>
> > `-You can’t praise yourself - you walk around all day like you’ve been spat on!`

### Multitechnics

##### Es: Shouldn't we reduce the essence?
A person's attention is limited to a few things <br>
Subconscious attention also has a limited overview <br>
The neural network of the brain works better with one task at a time; bifurcation is extremely costly
##### Av: Availability/Proximity/Simplicity
It's easier to climb onto a standing ladder <br>
A smart person won't go uphill until a monkey invents a ladder.
##### F: Focus: focus on...
What 3 tasks need to be done in the near future to make the note better and greener? <br>
or <br>
What 3 areas need to be kept in mind in the near future so that the task does not turn into a swamp?
##### G: Game: task management as gameplay

### General measures to support motivation
**Check plans for the day** <br>
**Check weekly plans** <br>
**Check monthly plans** <br>
**Check plans for the year** <br>
**Check the mood resource** - the potential for spending it today; reason for resource leakage; the closest source of obtaining the resource; <br>
**Check the amount of sleep** - exhaustion takes away cognitive ease <br>
**Check your daily caffeine and tea intake**

### Motivation techniques
**Overrepresentation of the goal** - describe how the goal looks, what it smells like, what model it has, length, how pleasant it is to touch it (people would like a lot, but don’t know what most, which means all goals fade in themselves with their vague priority. Lacks passion for one thing) <br>
**Contemplation factor** - you need to think and visualize the task for N amount of time in order to make something beautiful go far, we can handle it <br>
**Live high** - find a ladder with a strong dopamine response in order to control the construction of other ladders from it (a clear stage with a result) <br>
**Shoot the nearest hare** - when the priority of a target is lowered due to failure/failure, switch attention to the nearest target that is performed in parallel (usually a couple of targets are performed in parallel in a complex and a dozen floors above/below. Failures can result in training some technique or creating artificial slide for the formation of an emotional driver) <br>
**Get involved in battle and then we’ll see** - Napoleon’s tactic for quick motivation. For example, when emotions are dulled and memories are erased <br>
**Reconnaissance in force** - with insignificant losses you can acquire more - vision of new opportunities and prospects <br>
**Success Diary** - write with high quality (design, flow, usability) <br>
**Diary of a Crazy Developer** - bam bam tibidoh and in production - about half of the startups whose code would not have been formulated otherwise <br>
**Keep it while it's hot** - sometimes you wake up like a bird, with a winged spring on edge, and you want to live and spin, but by breakfast it goes away <br>
**Copy the way of thinking** - read a book about stairs to think like a carpenter, smell like a carpenter <br>
**Reading motivational books** - read books where you are artificially kicked in order to synergize your kicks with theirs. It is harder to generate water from yourself (paint) than from books <br>

### Analysis techniques
**The shortest path to the goal** - when abstractions begin, highlight the main, short thread <br>
**Goldilocks zone** - do not make too complex and do not make too simple stairs. Complex things leave a residue that prevents consolidation; simple things deprive you of excitement and pleasure <br>
**The very essence** with subtypes *Steal like an artist* - understand the very essence of something in order to go further; chew to swallow; The essence itself is a variation of “there is the most important thing, and there is everything else,” but the need to read essentialism is replaced by the need to read the instructions for the paint for the stairs, and the method of mixing it with thinners. *The very essence* is opposed to *1 stage at a time* - a stage is a brick, the very essence is cementing a fulcrum on putrefactive soil, otherwise the ladder will begin to descend; <br>
**Start over** - the last factor is the one that controls dead-end actions; cancel all overly abstract axioms taken and return to the origins of the reasoning to create a ladder from scratch, and then compare the result and combine; <br>
**Narrow neck**

### Execution techniques
**Superconcentration with a tomato** - think only about some point N of time. https://pomodoro-tracker.com/ <br>
**Divide and conquer** - think about some point on a blank sheet of paper and away from other stimuli, including the phone. Especially the phone<br>
**Pull factor** - do a task without motivation and aversion for N amount of time so that motivation kicks in <br>
**Bite in mouth factor** - 1 stage at a time - with full concentration <br>
**Periodization (stress control)** - use periodizations like “[school]”, “[office]”, “[periodicals]”, “[Limits and limiters]” to distribute the load and control biological cycles <br>
> [school] - 45 minutes of work, 15 minutes of distraction <br>
> [office] - 2-hour breaks, rest room, getting ready, communication and visualization <br>
> [limits and limiters] - control of the speed and sources of switching the attention of consciousness <br>
> [periodicals] - partial synthesis of what is listed in the note <br>

**Mix** - to make the unpleasant or unusual with the pleasant. Doing unpleasant things with the thought “you just won” - looking for something to gain that, like a crutch, can help you get things done <br>
**Copy-to-write factor** - draw a staircase as a project and paint it with paints like a schoolgirl (thoughtful comprehension) <br>
**Paint several times** - paint the stairs 3 times so that the paint is light and even and does not peel off due to weather conditions <br>
**Time Stamps** - make timestamps as you type [45] for real-time load visualization <br>
**Steal like an artist** - take someone else's ladder and disassemble it piece by piece to figure out the structure and improve it
